# Android_Malware_Detection
Android Malware detection
# Introduction
With the popularity of Android devices, the number of applications made for the android operating system is
also increasing day by day. But the biggest challenge in this scenario is to identify if an application is an authentic
application or a malware. This project tries to identify an application as malware/not based on the permissions
required by the application.
# Dataset
The dataset given here is taken from Kaggle and consists of about 331 features which are the different android
permissions asked by the application (0 denotes not required and 1 denotes required). The no rows/malware
readings for each permission is 398. It is the ‘type’ label which represents a given row corresponding to whether
an application is malware or not.
# Tasks in this assignment
1) Write a Data Science Proposal for achieving the objective mentioned.
2) Perform exploratory analysis on the data and describe your understanding of the data.
3) Perform data wrangling / pre-processing on the data if required
a. E.g., missing data, normalization, discretization, etc.
4) Apply any two feature engineering techniques.
5) Plot top 10 features.
6) Implement any two Machine Learning models (SVM or Decision Tree or Random Forest or kNN or Naïve
Bayes etc)
7) Compare the performance of the two models. Provide a table for comparison. (Here you may use the
combination of FE1+ML1, FE1+ML2, FE2+ML1 and FE2+ML2 etc)
8) Present the conclusions/results in the format shared.
